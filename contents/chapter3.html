													<h3>Questions and answers</h3>
												</header>
												<p>
													A programmer writes a program and <b>the program asks questions.</b> <br>
													A computer executes the program and provides the answers
													<ul>
														<li>
															Yes, this is true.
														</li>
														<li>
															No, this is false.
														</li>
													</ul>
													You will never get a response like <i>'Let me think..., i don't know, or probably  yes but I don't know for sure'.</i>
													To <strong>ask questionsm Python uses a set of very special operators</strong>. Let's go through them one after another, illustrating their effects on some simple examples.
												</p>
												<h2>Comparison: equality operator.</h2>
												<p>
													Question: <strong>are two values equal?</strong> 
													<p>	
														To ask this question, you use the <code>==</code> (equal equal) operator. <br>
														Don't forget this important distintion:
														<ul>
															<li><code>=</code> is an assignment operator, e.g. <code>a=b</code> assigns 'a' with the value of 'b'.</li>
															<li><code>==</code> is the question are these values equal?, <code>a==b</code> compares 'a' and 'b'.</li>
														</ul>
														It's a <strong>binary operator with left-sided binding</strong>. It needs two arguments and <b>check if they are equal</b>.
													</p>
													<h3>Exercises.</h3>
													<p>
														Now let's ask a few questions. try to guess the answers.
														<hr>
														<strong>Q.1</strong> What is the result of the following comparison? <code>2==2</code> <br>
														<blockquote>
															<code>True</code> of course, 2 is equal to 2. Python will answer True (remeber this pair of predefined literals, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> - they're Python keywords, too).
														</blockquote>
														<strong>Q.2</strong> What is the result of the following comparison? <code>2==2.</code> <br>
														<blockquote>
															This question is not as easy  as their  first one. Luckly, Python is able to convert the integer value into its real equivalent, andconsequently, the answer is <code>True</code>.
														</blockquote>
														<strong>Q.3</strong> What is the result of the following comparison? <code>1==2</code> <br>
														<blockquote>
															This should be easy. The answer will be (or rather, always is) <code>False</code>.
														</blockquote>
													</p>
												</p>
												<h2>Equality: the equal to operator (==)</h2>
												<p>
													The == (equal to) operator compares the values of two operands. If they are equal, the result of the comparison is <code>True</code>. If they are not equal, the result of the comparison is <code>False</code>. <br>
													Look at the equality comparison below - what is the result of this operation? <br>
													<code>
														var == 0
													</code> <br>
													Note that we cannot find the answer if we do not know what value is currently stored in the variable <code>var</code>. <br>
													If the variable has been changed many times during the execution of your program, or its initial value is entered from the console, the answer to this question can be given only by Python and only at runtime. <br>
													Now imagine a programmer who suffers from insomnia, and has to count black and white sheep separately as long as there are exactly twice as many black sheep as white ones. <br>
													The question will be as follows: <br>
													<code>
														black_sheep == 2 * white_sheep
													</code> <br>
													Due to the low priority of the <code>==</code> operator, the question shall be treated as equivalent to this one: <br>
													<code>
														black_sheep == (2 * white_sheep)
													</code> <br>
													So, let's practice your understanding of the == operator now - can you guess the output of the code below? <br>
<pre>	var = 0 # assigning 0 to var
	print(var == 0)
	var = 1 # assigning 1 to var
	print(var == 0)
	</pre>													
													Run the code and check if you were right.
													<div>
														<img src="images/equality-the equal to operator.PNG" class="responsive" alt=""> <p>Equal to operator.</p>
													</div>
												</p>
												<h2>Inequality: the not equal to operator (!=)</h2>
												<p>
													The <code>!=</code> (not equal to) operator compares the values of two operands, too. Here is the difference: if they are equal, the result of the comparison is False. If they are not equal, the result of the comparison is True.
													Now take a look at the inequality comparison below - can you guess the result of this operation?
													<pre>
	var = 0 # assigning 0 to var
	print(var != 0)
	var = 1 # assigning 1 to var
	print(var != 0)														
													</pre>
													Run the code and check if you were right.
													<div>
														<img src="images/inequality-the not equal to operator.PNG" class="responsive" alt=""> <p>Equal to operator.</p>
													</div>
												</p>
												<h2>Comparison operators: greater than</h2>
												<p>
													You can also ask a comparison question using the <code>></code> (greater than) operator.
													If you want to know if there are more black sheep than white ones, you can write it as follows: <br>
													<code>
														black_sheep > white_sheep # greater than
													</code>  <br>
													True confirms it; False denies it.
												</p>
												<h2>Comparison operators: greater than or equal to</h2>
												<p>
													The greater than operator has another special, non-strict variant, but it's denoted differently than in classical arithmetic notation: <code>>=</code>(greater than or equal to). <br>
													There are two subsequent signs, not one. <br>
													Both of these operators (strict and non-strict), as well as the two others discussed in the next section, are binary operators with left-sided binding, and their priority is greater than that shown by == and !=. <br>
													If we want to find out whether or not we have to wear a warm hat, we ask the following question: <br>
													<code>
														centigrade_outside ≥ 0.0 # greater than or equal to
													</code> 
												</p>
												<h2>Comparison operator: less than or equal to</h2>
												<p>
													As you've probably already guessed, the operators used in this case are: the <code><</code> (less than) operator and its non-strict sibling: <code><=</code> (less than or equal to). Look at this simple example: <br>
													<blockquote>
														current_velocity_mph <b><</b> 85 # less than
														current_velocity_mph <b>≤</b> 85 # less than or equal to
													</blockquote>
													We're going to check if there's a risk of being fined by the highway police (the first question is strict, the second isn't).
													Making use of the answers <br>
													What can you do with the answer (i.e., the result of a comparison operation) you get from the computer? <br>
													There are at least two possibilities: first, you can memorize it (store it in a variable) and make use of it later. How do you do that? Well, you would use an arbitrary variable like this: <br>
													<code>
														answer = number_of_lions >= number_of_lionesses
													</code> <br>
													The content of the variable will tell you the answer to the question asked. <br>													
													The second possibility is more convenient and far more common: you can use the answer you get to make a decision about the future of the program. <br>													
													You need a special instruction for this purpose, and we'll discuss it very soon. Now we need to update our priority table, and put all the new operators into it. It now looks as follows:
													<table>
														<tr>
															<td>
																Priority
															</td>
															<td>
																Operator

												<h2>Conditions and conditional execution.</h2>
												<p>
													You already know how to ask Python questions, but you still don't know how to make reasonable use of the answers. You have to have a machanism which allow you to do something 
													<b>if a condition is met, and not do it isn't.</b> <br>
													It's just like in real life: you do certain things or you don't when a specific condition is met or not, e.g. you go for a walk if the weather is good, or stay home if it's wet and cold. <br>
													To make such decision, Python offers a special instruction. Due to its nature and its application, it's called a <strong>condition instruction</strong> (or conditional statement). <br>
													There are several variants of it. We'll start with the simplest, increasing the difficulty slowly. <br>
													The first form of a conditional statement, which you can see below is written very informally but figuratively: <br>
													<blockquote>
														<strong>if</strong> true_or_not: <br>
															&nbsp;&nbsp; do_this_if_true
													</blockquote> 
													This conditional statement consists of the following, strictly necessary, elementes in this and this order only: 
													<ul>
														<li>
															The <code>if</code> keyword.
														</li>
														<li>
															One or more white spaces.
														</li>
														<li>
															An expression (a question or an answer) whose value will be interpreted solely in terms of <code>True</code> (when its value is non-zero) and 
															<code>False</code> (when it's equal to zero).
														</li>
														<li>
															A <strong>colon</strong> followed by a newline.
														</li>
														<li>
															An <strong>indented</strong> instruction or set of instructions (at least one instruction is absolutely required), the <strong>indentation</strong> may be 
															achieved in two ways - by inserting a particular number of spaces (the recommedation is to use <b>four spaces of indentation</b> ), or by using the <i>tab</i> character; 
															<b>note</b>: if there is more than one instruction in the indented part, the indentation should be the same in all lines, even though it may look the same if 
															you use tabs mixed whit spaces, it's important to make all indentations <b>exactly the same</b> Python 3 <b>does not allow mixing spaces and tabs</b> for indentation. 
														</li>
													</ul>
													How does that statement work? 
													<ul>
														<li>
															If the <code>true_or_not</code> expression <b>represent the truth</b>(i.e, its value not equal to zero), the indented statement(s) will be executed.
														</li>
														<li>
															If the <code>true_or_not</code> expression <b>does not represent the truth</b> (i.e, its value is equal to zero), the indented statement(s) will be omitted (ignored), and 
															the next executed instruction will be the one after the original indentation level.
														</li>
													</ul>
													In real life, we often express a desire: 
													<blockquote>
														if the weather is good, we'll go for a walk <br>
														then, we'll have lunch
													</blockquote>
													As you can see, having lunch is not a conditional activity and doesn't depend on the weather. <br>
													Knowing what conditions influence our behavior,and assuming that we have the parameterless functions <code>go_for_a_walk()</code>
													and <code>have_lunch()</code>, we can write the following snippet:
													<blockquote>
<pre>if the_weather_is_good:
	go_for_a_walk()
have_lunch()
</pre>														
													</blockquote>
